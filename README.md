----

A project built in collaboration with Simeng Yang, Zong Xu, and Jeremy Afoke for our first year term project.

Built using *RobotC* and *C++* along with a *Lego Mindstroms NXT* kit and a *Tetrix* kit.

The plotter uses a pen, pencil or marker to print on most sizes of paper through a three-axes translation system.
