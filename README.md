# 2DPlottingRobot
**1A Mechatronics Engineering Project at the University of Waterloo**
----

A project built in collaboration with Simeng Yang, Zong Xu, and Jeremy Afoke for our first year term project.

Built using *RobotC* and *C++* along with a *Lego Mindstroms NXT* kit and a *Tetrix* kit.

The plotter uses a pen, pencil or marker to print on most sizes of paper through a three-axes translation system.


Demonstration can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q8S1UCZuTU

### Info
----

+ *resources.zip* has all of the files required to use a C++ Graphics class
+ *sketch_it.zip* is a C++ project which allows users to input their own custom valid print request
+ The robot has two methods of input,  
    -> Pre-determined shape from NXT  
    -> External User Gui which communicates to the NXT
